I had a small incident yesterday that caused me to go on a hunt this morning to find a solution. The file explorer view in VS Code made it hard to tell which folder a file was in. I was looking at the wrong file for quite some time. I found [a great discussion in the VS Codes issues on GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17777) and found a solution. Here is my implementation.
