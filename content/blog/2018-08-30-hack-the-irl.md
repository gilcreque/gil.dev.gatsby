I was asked to be the Head of Hacker Experience for the inaugural [Hack the IRL hackathon](http://hacktheirl.com/). I'm looking forward to connecting with more people in the tech and creatives community! Here is a write up by Fumiko Shinkawa, Community Manager at [Groundswell](https://swellstartups.com/) and Head of Logistics for Hack the IRL, on [everything you need to know before your first hackathon](https://medium.com/groundswellstartups/everything-you-need-to-know-before-your-first-hackathon-f3aee3638a5).
