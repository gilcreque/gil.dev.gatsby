I'm finally updating my nameplate site and migrating my blogging to [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) which is based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), arguably the most developed static site generator that is currently available.

Another reason I went with [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) is to learn some basic Ruby. Most of my web development has been in PHP either through custom code, Wordpress, or Drupal. Lately most of my webdev work has been in ASP.NET/C# while updating an existing application to work on AWS as well as general refactoring. However, Ruby has a huge following in the web development world, one of my main areas of interest, so it would behoove me to learn as much as I can.
