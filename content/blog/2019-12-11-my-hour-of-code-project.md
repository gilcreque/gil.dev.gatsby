Yesterday was the beginning of [Computer Science Education Week][1]. To kick things off at Codecraft Works we did [a live stream from our office][2]. I taught [a lesson on CSS Filters][3] and how you can create Instagram-like filters using them. My co-workers taught lessons on [making a piano][4] and on [making a game][5].
