We spent the weekend hanging out in the cabin just outside Blue Ridge, Georgia. We explored Downtown Blue Ridge a few times as the area has really grown to accommodate mountain tourists like ourselves. Fun times had by all except for those few scary moments coming up and down the mountain in an underpowered front wheel drive skateboard...I mean sedan.
