Matt Phillips found an old Sega hardware development kit and created a new game for the Sega Genesis/Megadrive game and will be releasing it this year on physical cartridges (and PC downloadable versions as well). [Scott Hanselman interviews Matt](https://hanselminutes.com/625/a-new-sega-megadrivegenesis-game-in-2018-with-1995-tools-with-tanglewoods-matt-phillips) on creating the game (where I first heard about this).
