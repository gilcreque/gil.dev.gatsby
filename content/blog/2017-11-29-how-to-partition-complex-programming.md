> **Run/Right/Fast**. The classic problem partitioning strategy, taught to me by my dear departed Pappy on the first day I started programming, is to make the code work then make is clean then make it fast (if necessary). Solving the “correct/clean/performant code” problem all at once can be overwhelming. Don’t be overwhelmed. Solve one at a time.

There is a lot of great advice in [this post](https://www.facebook.com/notes/kent-beck/one-bite-at-a-time-partitioning-complexity/1716882961677894/) but the above is something I try to practice every time I seat down to write code.
