This past election cycle I volunteered with [DevProgress](https://devprogress.us/), an open source volunteer tech team for the Hillary campaign (along with the rest of the Democratic Party). It was great seeing this kind of involvement online and after the election (likely due to the result of the election) I noticed that more and more digital political and advocacy tools were starting to pop up so I started bookmarking them here. I figured I would go ahead and share the list and keep adding to it as I find more.
