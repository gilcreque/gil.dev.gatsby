I don't remember how or  when I stumbled upon the [DC Tech Slack](http://www.dctechslack.com/) but I remember immediately loving the idea. It reminded me of a similar idea that [Justin Jackson](https://justinjackson.ca/) had with his [Product People Club](https://productpeople.club/) and the work [Gregg Pollack](https://www.greggpollack.com/) does for the Orlando tech scene with [Orlando Tech Events](http://techevents.us/orlando/).  I used to go to A LOT more meetups and events but life has gotten real busy, especially with a kid. The idea of being able to connect with those same people I used to see in person on occasion and to meet new people was alluring and when [Hover](https://www.hover.com/) decided to have a sale on domain names I started looking at what they had available. I picked one out and set up a few things but I got extremely busy with a new job. Fast forward 3 months and here I am asking people to [join this new community](http://spacecoasttech.club/) I hobbled together using freely available resources. Please join and share your ideas. I would love to hear them. Thanks.
