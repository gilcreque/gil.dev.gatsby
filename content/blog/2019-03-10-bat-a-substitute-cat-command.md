While watching [Suz Hinton/noopkat's Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/393424707) today I noticed that when she ran the `cat` command it looked a little different than what I was used to. It has some subtle styling to it I had never seen before. I found out from the [#noopkrew](https://twitter.com/hashtag/noopkrew) that it was the `[bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)` [command](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat), a substitute `cat` command with some superpowers. I brew installed it immediately and [set up an alias](https://github.com/gilcreque/dotfiles/blob/e8e2a82d3633eb2c5f438e8bb4940cf0ee0868ee/.aliases#L4) to replace `cat`. Think of it as Apple's Quick Look but for the command line. It does syntax highlighting for several filetypes including JSON and Markdown. It is also git aware and can show diffs in files. Amazing!!
