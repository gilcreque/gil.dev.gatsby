I remember reading about [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) sometime last year and it sounded cool but I haven't had time to dive into a new topic like this in a while. Fast forward to today and I've been working on learning more modern web development, particularly Angular, some Node, Firebase, and TypeScript. On occasion, I try to watch or listen to [AngularAir](https://angularair.com/) and this past week they were discussing GraphQL which had me pretty excited. [Bonnie Brennan](https://twitter.com/bonnster75) walks through the very basics of implementing GraphQL using [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/). The flexibility of GraphQL is amazing. You can use a variety of data sources on the back end and have it all be accessed via GraphQL. Some main takeaway points I took from this is:

- You can have a GraphQL endpoint that can return just the fields you need from your data, not the entire object graph
- You can combine various data sources on the back end and deliver them using your GraphQL endpoint
- You can push data from the server to the client
- The business logic can sit on the server and reduce your bundle sizes in your JS front-end app

I went down a rabbit hole after listening (and then watching) this episode of ngAir. I stumbled upon this other great video from Scott from [LevelUpTuts](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyU5wkjgQYGRB0hIHMwm2Sg)/[Syntax Podcast](https://syntax.fm/).

I'll definitely be diving deeper into this very soon. I'm pretty sure I'll implement on [my side project](https://space-coast-tech-club.firebaseapp.com/).
