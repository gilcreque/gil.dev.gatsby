I returned the CableCARD and tuner box at Spectrum to start off the new year not paying for things we don't use. I also inquired about what Internet only plans were available and, to my surprise, I found out that Spectrum's Internet plans are cheaper than the Brighthouse plan I was still on. For $2 less a month I now get 400 Mbps down. I just wanted to share in case anyone else hasn't checked in with Spectrum after the switchover.

P.S. I've been trying DirecTV Now on the Apple TV. It is okay but the Apple remote is lacking, you can't rewind "live" TV, and the DVR service will erase stuff before we've watched it.
