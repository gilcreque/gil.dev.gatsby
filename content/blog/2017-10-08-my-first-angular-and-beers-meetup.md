I enjoyed my first [Angular and Beers meeting](https://www.meetup.com/GDGSpaceCoast/events/243859601/) hosted by the [Google Developers Group - Space Coast](http://www.gdgspacecoast.org/)  and [Groundswell](http://swellstartups.com/). We got learn more about using [Material Design components in Angular](https://material.angular.io/components). Thanks to Michael Prentice for speaking and sponsoring the event.
