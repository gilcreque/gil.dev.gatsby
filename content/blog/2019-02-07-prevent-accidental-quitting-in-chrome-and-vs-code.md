I had already taken of this problem in Google Chrome by choosing to be warned before quitting from the Chrome menu.

This stops Chrome from immediately quitting when you hit CMD+Q. I would do this by accident usually when trying to select all (CMD+A). I was running across this in VS Code and found an extension that will do the same thing.
