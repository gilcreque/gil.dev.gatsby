I've been exploring the world of front-end frameworks lately. In particular I've been looking at what [Angular](https://angular.io/) has to offer to us old heads[\[1\]](#fn1) and I have to say I like what I see. I've been going through a free course on [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angularjs) to get the basics. In addition to Angular I've also been reading up on using [.NET Core to build microservices](https://opbuildstorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/output-pdf-files/en-us/VS.core-docs/live/standard/microservices-architecture.pdf). Web development of the future is here and I need to learn more about it[\[2\]](#fn2).

[\[1\]](#r1) This term is used a lot in hip hop culture referring to us "old" dudes who like stuff from back in the day. Urban Dictionary has a [pretty good definition](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Old+Head&defid=8167206):

> 1\. Someone who has been in the scene before you or your group.

[\[2\]](#r2) I remember looking at Angular when it was transitioning to Angular2 and thought it was still very fluid and I didn't want to invest the time into learning it then.
