I started playing around with some new tech last night after consolidating my Linode servers. First up is the [Caddy Web Server](https://caddyserver.com). Super easy to setup and get HTTP/2 and free SSL certs out of the box. It's mind-blowing! Next up is [Byobu](http://byobu.org/), a utility to automate screen/tmux session connection on \*nix boxes. Looks like it will work on the Mac too.
