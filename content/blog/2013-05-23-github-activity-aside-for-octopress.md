While working on my new [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) powered site I began to look at the plugins provided by default. The Github repo plugin didn't really show what I wanted on my site so I refactored it to show my GitHub activity instead. I've only coded about 7 or so event types thus far but I will continue to work on this plugin and release it on GitHub of course. \[gist https://gist.github.com/5632365\]
