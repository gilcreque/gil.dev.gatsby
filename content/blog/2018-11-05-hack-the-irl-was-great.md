What a great weekend! [Hack the IRL](http://hacktheirl.com) was a great success! After months of planning and hard work by the team, it all came together this weekend quite beautifully. We had a lot of great participants, mentors, volunteers, sponsors, and projects and it was exciting to see a new community get built over the 36-hours that we all spent together. [Check out the projects](https://hacktheirl.devpost.com/submissions) that the teams created.
